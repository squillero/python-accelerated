## Summary

* Crash course: 5 days, 7 hours a day
    * Not a *gentle introduction to...*
    * Not the usual *Dummy's guide to...*    
* The audience is expected to know the fundamentals of programming in any C-like language
* The course does not cover OOP in Python â€” although objects in Python are beautiful
